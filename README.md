---

Fork of AppImageUpdate with the following advantages: 

* **Unrestricted operation:** Efficiently bypasses rate limits for seamless updates.

* **Truly works everywhere:** Works on any linux distros, **be it musl distro or 10 year old distro** 

* **Debloated:** Optimized to significantly reduce file size **to half the original** without compromising functionality.

Additionally, this enhanced edition combines the `validate` and `appimageupdatetool` CLI into a single AppImage. Symlink the AppImage as `validate` for direct usage or give `validate` as the first argument to use it.
    
**Why use this application?**
